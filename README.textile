h1. grails-cucumber

grails-cucumber makes it possible to write cucumber tests in ruby/gherkin and have them executed against your grails application as a cucumber test phase. No need to have ruby installed, and will work with any additional gems you may wish to use.

h2. Installing and configuring grails-cucumber

Install the plugin by executing the standard installation command:
<pre>grails install-plugin grails-cucumber</pre>

Once installed a 'cucumber' script will be made available and a base directory structure will be created for your cucumber tests.
<pre>
test/
    features/
        step_definitions/
        support/
</pre>

To use gems outside of cucumber (ie capybara, rspec) simply list them in BuildConfig.groovy as a list of gems.

<pre>
gems = [ 'capybara', 'rspec' ]
</pre>

h2. Running cucumber tests

Run the following command to run through your cucumber tests.
<pre>
grails cucumber
</pre>

And a report will be generated in target/test-reports/html/cucumber.html

h2. Next stps

be able clean gems
run one test (or test pattern) at a time
run tests in 'development' mode - against a running server
switch driver at build time - IE, firefox, chrome, etc
